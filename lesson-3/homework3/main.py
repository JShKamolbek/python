## 1 Create and Access List Elements (Create a list containing five different fruits and print the third fruit.)
ls = ["Olma", "Nok", "Banan", "Behi", "Uzum"]
print(ls[3])

## 2. Concatenate Two Lists (Create two lists of numbers and concatenate them into a single list.)
ls1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
ls2 = [6, 5, 4, 3]
ls1.extend(ls2)
ls1

## 3. Extract Elements from a List (Given a list of numbers, extract the first, middle, and last elements and store them in a new list.)
ls = ["Salom", 3, "men", 88, "dasturchiman"]
ls2 = [ls[0], ls[len(ls)//2], ls[len(ls)-1]]
ls2
